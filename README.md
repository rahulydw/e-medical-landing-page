# 🩺 Medical - Landing Page UI

A clean, minimal, and modern **Medical Landing Page** created as a **frontend practice project** by [@rahulydw](https://github.com/rahulydw) (Rahul Yadav).  
This UI is purely based on a **Figma design inspiration** and built using **React + Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 📋 Project Purpose

This is a **UI-only landing page prototype** built to sharpen frontend skills and design-to-code practice.  
It is **not production ready**, and all the components like buttons and forms are **non-functional** at this stage.

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

- ✅ Mobile: Fully responsive  
- ✅ Desktop: Fully responsive  
- ⚠️ Tablet: Rough layout only (Not optimized yet)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React (Vite setup)  
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS  
- 📐 Figma (used for layout reference)  
- ❌ No external component libraries used

---

## 🚧 Features & Notes

- 🖼️ Based on Figma design  
- 🧪 Dummy buttons and form – **Not functional**  
- 🔧 Clean and reusable components  
- 🔹 Purely built for **practice and learning purpose**

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Future Scope

If you like the design and UI structure, I can upgrade this to:
- A **fully responsive** experience (including Tablet)
- Add working features (buttons, forms, navigation)
- Integrate APIs and user interactivity
